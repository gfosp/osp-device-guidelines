Some guidelines that make sense when coming up with the best phone possible: The OSP phone

# Idea
The idea is to develop a phone worthy of developers attention, worthy of a price that Samsung is claiming for their phones already now.

The idea is to be able to multi-boot: Android, iOS, OSPos (OSP's own OS)

The tricky thing will be leveraging Google & Apple, of course. If we can also get SAMSUNG in the mix, that'd be great.<br>An option to install TouchWiz as addition would be great.

Another tricky thing are the hardware limitations which also includes replacing the hardware method for the special modes (recovery mode etc.)

However, in the best case scenario: We'll have an iOS that runs on Android hardware and an Android running on iOS hardware.

That way users can decide, do they want to go with Apple's design - or with the design of one of Android's devices.

One question to which so far no answer exists is if the option should exist to launch certain Android apps directly from iOS Home screen and vice versa.<br>
I think my brain just answered this: It should definetly be possible.<br>What's more: Apps should have an API (which by default requests access every time) that allows them to open an app of the opposite OS. OSPos could act as a bridge. (But in best conditions you wouldn't notice that OSP is acting as a bridge.)

One option could be to have two chipsets in one phone. - But it would be power consuming and probably/hopefully not necessary.

Anything will probably only work on a few verified high-end or new devices.
